# Credit-Card-Fraud
Building a robust Credit Card Fraud Detection system to identify suspicious transactions in an imbalanced dataset. Using SMOTE for oversampling and Random Forest, the model achieves high recall for the minority class. Features include data scaling, feature engineering, and a saved pipeline with Joblib for real-world deployment.
Data Source: This project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) . Please download the creditcard.csv file and place it in the /data folder to run the notebook.
